    	<h3>Hello!</h3>
    	<p><br/>I am from Chelyabinsk, Russia. Now I'm livin' in Saint Petersburg. Art is a part of my life and I love it. I finished a School of Fine Arts in my hometown. I studied there for five years. I think that means a lot for my skill. I draw as long as I can remember.<br/><br/>Last year I studied at the University at the faculty of design, but left to do what I love.<br/><br/>A year ago, I finished tattoo courses and during this year  I sketched and created pictures on the bodies. I acquired professional equipment and imbued with the subtleties of this art. <br/><br/>If you're dreaming about tattoo I will fulfill this dream. Dreams must come true. <a href="/contact" style="text-decoration: none">Contact</a> me and I will answer all your questions!</p>
